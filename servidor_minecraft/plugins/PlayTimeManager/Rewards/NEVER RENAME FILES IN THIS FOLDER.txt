NEVER RENAME FILES IN THIS FOLDER
--------------------------------------------------
WARNING: The files in this folder are named according to their ID.
Changing the names of these files will cause the configuration files to be missing in the database.
This could result in failures as IDs are used by the plugin, and modifying the file names will break the mapping.
ID values should never be changed by the user.
