#    WARNING: This is a default template that gets overwritten after each plugin reload.
#    Copy this file or create your own custom format definitions to preserve changes.

# OVERVIEW:
# This file defines custom time display formats that can be referenced throughout the plugin
# using %PLAYTIME:format-name% syntax in configuration messages, where format-name is the name of the related format file.
# For example, to use the default format you would write %PLAYTIME:default% or simply %PLAYTIME% (default is used when format is omitted).

# HOW IT WORKS:
# Create a new file under 'Customization/PlaytimeFormats' with your desired format name, then define text
# labels for time units (years, days, hours, minutes, seconds) and create a formatting string
# that combines all units you need. You can then reference your format using %PLAYTIME:file-name% in plugin
# messages like "Your playtime is %PLAYTIME:short%" or "Player time: %PLAYTIME:compact%".

# FORMATTING SYSTEM:
# Use %y%, %d%, %h%, %m%, %s% as time value placeholders (these cannot be modified) and
# {years}, {days}, {hours}, {minutes}, {seconds} for unit labels. Zero values are automatically
# hidden (e.g., 0 years won't display), and singular/plural forms are automatically selected
# based on the time value.

# CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
# You can omit time units you don't need from the formatting field
# and use different separators like commas, spaces, or custom text to create
# the exact display style you want.
