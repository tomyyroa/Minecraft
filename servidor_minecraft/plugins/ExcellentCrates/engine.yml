  Cache:
    # Sets cache lifetime for player's data.

  # [DO NOT DISABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!]
  # [20 ticks = 1 second]
  # [Default is 20]
  Scheduled_Save_Interval: 20
  # Sets scheduled save delay (in seconds) for a user when marked to be saved.
  # This means that a user will be saved X seconds later after being marked.
  # Generally, you should keep this value less than 'Scheduled_Save_Interval' for best results,
  # and not setting it extremely high, otherwise you may result in user data never saved & synchronized.
  #
  # IMPORTANT NOTE #1: When a user is marked for saving, this will prevent them from syncing until saving occurs!
  # IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Every time a user is marked for saving, their save time will be updated with this value!
  #
  # Users marked for save when their data has been changed/affected in some way.
  # However this is higly depends on the plugin.
  # [Decimals allowed]
  # [Default is 1]
  Scheduled_Save_Delay: 1.0
  # Sets synchronization delay (in seconds) before the plugin can continue syncing data for a user after its scheduled save.
  # When a user marked for saving has been saved, their synchronization will be unlocked but delayed for this value.
  # This might be helpful to prevent possible issues when synchronization process access the database before user data was fully saved.
  # [Default is 3]
